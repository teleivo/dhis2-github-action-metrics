That is confusing. The default\nis now that we run all types of tests if you do mvn test (unit, integration, integrationH2).\nThis way we cannot miss any tests in a pipeline due to forgetting to remove the default profile.\nOn Jenkins we simply do 'mvn clean install' wich runs all tests and creates the war. We can do that\nsince the machines running Jenkins have more resources than the ones on GH. On GitHub we now use\nthe maven profiles unit-test, integration-test, integration-h2-test to run each of them in a concurrent job.\n\nAuthTest was not properly classified as an integration test.
