This is why I had to\ngrep for analytics in the JSON fixture name to set an arg for run-simulation.sh.\n\nI recently hit https://github.com/dhis2/dhis2-core/pull/22236 where dhis2/core:42.2 failed to start\nwith the DB sierra-leone/2.41.0. We need to discuss how to deal with changes that then require user\nintervention from implementations. In that case we are the users/maintainers of the SL DBs.\n\nFor the time being devs need to be able to set different DBs for baseline and candidate. That means\neven more workflow parameters would be needed. A common workaround to the 10 input parameter\nlimitation is to take in multiline strings and parse them. Lucky for us run-simulation.sh\nalready spits out a run-simulation.env which you can use locally to reproduce a run. So now\nwe use the same pattern for the workflow itself.\n\nThe workflow should only allow comparing the same Gatling simulation and the same version of it. The\nfirst one is validated in a separate step. The second one ensured by the perf_tests_git_ref input.\nSo the GIT_ related env vars in a run-simulation.env are ignored.","timestamp":"2025-10-14T14:07:30Z","author":{"name":"teleivo","email":"teleivo@users.noreply.github.com"},"committer":{"name":"teleivo","email":"teleivo@users.noreply.github.com"}},"repository":{"id":66940520,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2Njk0MDUyMA==","name":"dhis2-core","full_name":"dhis2/dhis2-core","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dhis2","id":1089987,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjEwODk5ODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1089987?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhis2","html_url":"https://github.com/dhis2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhis2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhis2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhis2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhis2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhis2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhis2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhis2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhis2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhis2/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dhis2/dhis2-core","description":"DHIS 2 Core.
