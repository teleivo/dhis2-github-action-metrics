This means our log4j2 configuration has no\neffect, not in tests, not in production.\n\nWe should quiet down the build until we fix the root cause. By default\nSimpleLogger's level is INFO. The adds noise we have to ignore when\nlooking for warnings/errors. It most likely also adds to the test\nduration as it puts pressure on Surefire's forks/inter-process\ncommunication which uses unix pipes.\n\n* Log4JLogConfigInitializer programmatically creates loggers with file\n  appenders. There can only be one logger, so this class also has an\n  effect on the log4j2.xml config we use for testing. Some packages are\n  logging with level INFO because of it. This creates noise in our test\n  logs and might have a performance impact due to the Surefire\n  forking/inter-process communication happening between forked JVMs and\n  Surefire. If we can turn of INFO logging to files during tests even\n  better. We should definitely not log it to STDOUT.","timestamp":"2021-11-08T14:19:02Z","author":{"name":"teleivo","email":"teleivo@users.noreply.github.com"},"committer":{"name":"teleivo","email":"teleivo@users.noreply.github.com"}},"repository":{"id":66940520,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2Njk0MDUyMA==","name":"dhis2-core","full_name":"dhis2/dhis2-core","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dhis2","id":1089987,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjEwODk5ODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1089987?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhis2","html_url":"https://github.com/dhis2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhis2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhis2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhis2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhis2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhis2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhis2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhis2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhis2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhis2/received_events","type":"Organization","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dhis2/dhis2-core","description":"DHIS2 Core.
