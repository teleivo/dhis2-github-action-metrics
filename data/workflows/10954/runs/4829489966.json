Subpaths are only supported if the route is configured with a URL ending in `/**`, and can be accessed via the route's Run API like so - `/api/routes/ABC123/run/sub/path/xyz`, which if route `ABC123` is configured with the URL `https://google.com/**` would proxy the request to `https://google.com/sub/path/xyz`\n\nAttempting to access a subpath for a route which doesn't have the `/**` path wildcard suffix will result in a 400 Bad Request error (I'm not sure if this should be a 404 instead...)\n\nThis has been approved for 2.40.0 if we want to support it there (since this makes the routes API quite a bit more useful), though with this implementation it would also be a non-breaking extension to add `/**` support in v 40.1\n\n(cherry picked from commit 8ad5844aab98ead1c744dd57252b779dc49a20bc)","timestamp":"2023-04-28T10:07:35Z","author":{"name":"Austin McGee","email":"947888+amcgee@users.noreply.github.com"},"committer":{"name":"Austin McGee","email":"947888+amcgee@users.noreply.github.com"}},"repository":{"id":66940520,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2Njk0MDUyMA==","name":"dhis2-core","full_name":"dhis2/dhis2-core","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dhis2","id":1089987,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjEwODk5ODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1089987?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhis2","html_url":"https://github.com/dhis2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhis2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhis2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhis2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhis2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhis2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhis2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhis2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhis2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhis2/received_events","type":"Organization","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dhis2/dhis2-core","description":"DHIS 2 Core.
